We?ll then leverage composition to operate on complex data structures, avoid Optional handling with the Affine optic, and explore more sophisticated usages that go beyond data manipulation.",

This talk will focus on copybook headings of infosec: what you need to know before exciting stuff like cryptography and AI-assisted incident detection. Like, choice of data you show in the background mode, choice of 3rd party SDKs, which logs we send and where? Even when developers create apps with security in minds, protect user secrets, and don?t reveal unencrypted data, attackers can find ways to bypass these security measures by exploiting architectural weaknesses and unobvious, yet very simple vulnerabilities. We will talk about all the tiny bits and pieces are necessary to make your app secure against simple attacks way before focusing on the hard things (like crypto).",

We will use a swift wrapper around LLVM called LLVMSwift to implement a toy compiler in Swift for an example language.",

        "details": "SwiftNIO was developed with a focus on providing useful, high-performance tools for building event-driven networking applications on the server side. It turns out that these primitives also work well in client applications. While the primitives transfer over, the networking environment is very different, and the socket layer, which works well in a server environment, is substantially less suited to operating on mobile clients. For this reason, SwiftNIO provides integration with the brand new Network.framework on Apple's client devices: a modern network stack for a mobile age. This talk will discuss the powerful tools that Network.framework provides, and how SwiftNIO exposes them. It'll discuss the different design tradeoffs between server and client side, and cover some of the key differences in the networking environments. Finally, this talk will look to the future, and discuss how the server and client worlds could converge over time.",

        "details": "There are many similarities between ?designing user interfaces? and ?designing code.? Both are a means of communication: A user interface needs to communicate the app?s functionality to the user, code needs to express what it does to other developers. As a consequence, code also needs to be well designed, and developers can learn a lot from designers in that respect. The goal of this talk is to give developers the tools in their hand to write better code that?s easy to read and understand.",

The power of this great technology lies in how simple its foundations are. The engineers behind Auto Layout at Apple started to reveal more of the internals of their technology recently, to help us understand its principles better, in order to get the best performance out of our layout code.Let?s look more closely at how the Auto Layout engine solves constraints through exploring the Cassowary algorithm, that?s running under the hood, turning constraints into linear equations, and solving them. By doing the math ourselves, we?ll have a better understanding of what layouts are easier, or more difficult to satisfy. What coding practices can help us achieve best Auto Layout performance.",

In this talk we will try to provide a few techniques for improving those two areas of your apps from the points of view of the code, the use of tools we have available and the users? expected experience.nnA series of examples will be presented, showing how some of your users may perceive your app when localisation and accessibility are not correctly implemented or not implemented at all.nnYou would freak out if the ?Back? button was on the right side of the navigation bar, but that is what users that speak right-to-left written languages expect. If a modal view was presented without a ?Close/Done? button, you would consider it a bug, but it may exactly be what you are giving to blind users.nnSmartphones, apps and the whole Apple ecosystem has helped us develop much more inclusive apps that anyone can use.

        "details": "Swift introduced Optionals on day one, but some of us are still getting used to them. Used appropriately they can be very useful ? but they can also be abused!nSwift 1 didn?t have a cohesive error handling strategy. Exception-like features were introduced with Swift 2, but remain widely misunderstood.nShould you use Optionals for errors, or do-catch, or something else? Or not bother at all and rely on Bad Things never happening?nHow can we make sense of all this when, really, we just want to focus our efforts on getting everything to *work*, not worry about optimising for failures?nThis talk digs into what Swift really has to offer and shows it can all be much simpler than we?re making out ? and even fun!nWhether you?re just starting out with Swift, or you?re a seasoned veteran, there will be something for everyone in this talk.n",

        "details": "Several years have passed since Swift was released as open source and Linux became supported. The adoption of server side Swift has increased. Meanwhile, Swift is constantly being updated, and the cost of supporting different Swift versions on multiple machines is getting higher. By using Docker, this cost can be reduced by preparing a virtual environment container with a fixed Swift version, so we can develop without relying on version. Also, since Docker does not perform full virtualization, disk usage is small, and virtual environment initialization and startup are fast. In this talk, I'll explore the best Docker container for Swift.",
