Like, choice of data you show in the background mode, choice of 3rd party SDKs, which logs we send and where? Even when developers create apps with security in minds, protect user secrets, and don?t reveal unencrypted data, attackers can find ways to bypass these security measures by exploiting architectural weaknesses and unobvious, yet very simple vulnerabilities.

Equipped with a set of guidelines for executing Compassionate Code Reviews, you?ll leave inspired to apply them on your team to create better code and happier coders.",

It makes it easy to try different datasets ? getting your data right is actually the hardest and most time consuming part of ML. Once you get started with ML, you won?t want to wait / hope for Apple to add more models to Create ML.\n\nTo help you explore the ML universe that?s written in Python, I?ll reduce the fright factor by comparing Create ML Swift with Turi Create Python, and showing you how to quick-start your exploration of Turi Create.

In this talk we?ll share the history of how the app grew and came to a breaking point, how and why we decided to start anew, why we chose to create a new mobile architecture on the way and how it?s worked out for us. We will share our approach to making app development scale to very large apps and teams and what smaller teams can also take from this.",

It will also show how to refactor the test code for better readability, for example using Sourcery code generation tool.\nIt doesn't matter whether you have never written a single test case or are a veteran looking to push the testing to the limit.

In this talk, we will see that most criticisms of MVC do not really understand what MVC does and does not prescribe.

It turns out that these primitives also work well in client applications. While the primitives transfer over, the networking environment is very different, and the socket layer, which works well in a server environment, is substantially less suited to operating on mobile clients. For this reason, SwiftNIO provides integration with the brand new Network.framework on Apple's client devices: a modern network stack for a mobile age. This talk will discuss the powerful tools that Network.framework provides, and how SwiftNIO exposes them. It'll discuss the different design tradeoffs between server and client side, and cover some of the key differences in the networking environments. Finally, this talk will look to the future, and discuss how the server and client worlds could converge over time.",

Naturally not all Swift code is magically fast and just like everything else in programming performance requires constant learning.\n\nJohannes discusses one aspect of what was learned during SwiftNIO development.

In just a few days, your app is going to be available globally. But? is it really?\n\nAny developer of an app with an aim of reaching a global audience needs to localise the app (most of us do that), but also to make it accessible! It is a team effort and everyone, from Developers to UX Designers or Product Managers, need to be involved, and therefore, to know its basics. In this talk we will try to provide a few techniques for improving those two areas of your apps from the points of view of the code, the use of tools we have available and the users? expected experience.\n\nA series of examples will be presented, showing how some of your users may perceive your app when localisation and accessibility are not correctly implemented or not implemented at all.\n\nYou would freak out if the ?Back? button was on the right side of the navigation bar, but that is what users that speak right-to-left written languages expect. If a modal view was presented without a ?Close/Done? button, you would consider it a bug, but it may exactly be what you are giving to blind users.\n\nSmartphones, apps and the whole Apple ecosystem has helped us develop much more inclusive apps that anyone can use. But we can do better by building apps for everyone.",

Meanwhile, Swift is constantly being updated, and the cost of supporting different Swift versions on multiple machines is getting higher. By using Docker, this cost can be reduced by preparing a virtual environment container with a fixed Swift version, so we can develop without relying on version. Also, since Docker does not perform full virtualization, disk usage is small, and virtual environment initialization and startup are fast. In this talk, I'll explore the best Docker container for Swift.",
