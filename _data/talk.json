This talk will focus on copybook headings of infosec: what you need to know before exciting stuff like cryptography and AI-assisted incident detection. Like, choice of data you show in the background mode, choice of 3rd party SDKs, which logs we send and where? Even when developers create apps with security in minds, protect user secrets, and don?t reveal unencrypted data, attackers can find ways to bypass these security measures by exploiting architectural weaknesses and unobvious, yet very simple vulnerabilities. We will talk about all the tiny bits and pieces are necessary to make your app secure against simple attacks way before focusing on the hard things (like crypto).",

    "details" : "Development does not exist in a vacuum. Society is the biggest system we can impact and everything we do becomes a part of that system?both good and bad. Ultimately we must judge the weight and value of our work based on that impact. In order to properly do so though, we must a have a code of ethics in whatever we do because it allows us to measure our decisions against our values. An engineer is first and foremost a human being, but sometimes engineers and product folks in general ignore ethics and ship feature after feature to users without accounting for the impact outside of the positive metrics being aimed for. With this talk I will try to explain why people push unethical code into production and ways that we can prevent that from happening. We have a duty as people building products for people on the other end of the screen, to build a product that they can love and trust.",

Meanwhile, Swift is constantly being updated, and the cost of supporting different Swift versions on multiple machines is getting higher.

Also, since Docker does not perform full virtualization, disk usage is small, and virtual environment initialization and startup are fast.

In just a few days, your app is going to be available globally. But? is it really?\n\nAny developer of an app with an aim of reaching a global audience needs to localise the app (most of us do that), but also to make it accessible! It is a team effort and everyone, from Developers to UX Designers or Product Managers, need to be involved, and therefore, to know its basics. In this talk we will try to provide a few techniques for improving those two areas of your apps from the points of view of the code, the use of tools we have available and the users? expected experience.\n\nA series of examples will be presented, showing how some of your users may perceive your app when localisation and accessibility are not correctly implemented or not implemented at all.\n\nYou would freak out if the ?Back? button was on the right side of the navigation bar, but that is what users that speak right-to-left written languages expect. If a modal view was presented without a ?Close/Done? button, you would consider it a bug, but it may exactly be what you are giving to blind users.\n\nSmartphones, apps and the whole Apple ecosystem has helped us develop much more inclusive apps that anyone can use.

Encoding and decoding JSON often becomes the most complex part of working with RESTful APIs. Using Codable, Kitura 2.0 offers to take up the responsibility of JSON processing, allowing you to work directly with your own Codable types, in a type-safe manner. Using KituraKit, you may also share type definitions between the iOS app and the server side.",

With compassion as a guideline, though, we can work to establish code review practices that minimize suffering for everyone involved?the code authors, the code reviewers, the code maintainers, and even the end users.  In this talk, you?ll learn that Compassionate Code Reviews are not about ?sugarcoating? feedback and actually demand a considerable degree of candor. Equipped with a set of guidelines for executing Compassionate Code Reviews, you?ll leave inspired to apply them on your team to create better code and happier coders.",

We can even create our own views by subclassing UIView ourselves without even reaching into UIKit! But we can't reuse this view description on AppKit or for serialization. Imagine for a moment, we had EnumKit, it's like UIKit, but the views are provided as cases of an enum. Now we can reuse the view description, but we can no longer create our own views without reaching into EnumKit (or forking the library). The 'Final Tagless' approach gives us the best of both worlds taking advantage of Swift?s powerful Self type inside protocols.",

    "details" : "\"Gotta Go Fast (A Performance and Instruments Talk)\nIf you?ve been working on an iOS app for a while, you may have noticed that over time your once snappy app has started to feel a little sluggish. Your feed limps along with the occasional stall or maybe you?re trying to build a camera app but it seems to lag quite a bit behind reality. Contrary to popular opinion, our software is becoming increasingly demanding at a rate that easily exceeds how quickly our devices are improving. The talk explains how to track overall performance, find performance problems and how to fix a few big ones. Sprinkled throughout are 10 Rules for Good Performance.\"",

Therefore in those languages, the key to unlock performance is often to write some of the code in C, collaterally abandoning the safety of the higher-level language.\n\nSwift on the other hand lets you unlock best of both worlds: performance and safety. Naturally not all Swift code is magically fast and just like everything else in programming performance requires constant learning.\n\nJohannes discusses one aspect of what was learned during SwiftNIO development. He debunks one particular performance-related myth that has been in the Swift community ever since, namely that classes are faster to pass to functions than structs.",

In this talk, we will see that most criticisms of MVC do not really understand what MVC does and does not prescribe. But more importantly, they miss the point: The architecture pattern is not the problem, how we use it is. We will see that other architectures are prone to the same problems as MVC and we will see how to address them in both MVC and other architectures.",

This feature of Rx code decreases considerably the complexity of asynchronous code in comparison to traditional Cocoa code, which is often spread across multiple files and classes and executed in arbitrary order.\n\nWhile the talks starts with simple examples that everyone can relate to, it quickly moves on to a ?hardcore? part featuring code samples. If you want to learn more about the examples used, have a look at the dotSwift posts on rx-marin.com and clone the companion repo to play with some RxSwift yourself.",

Its usage is becoming widespread and popular with many companies moving their code base to the Reactive world across iOS, Android, Web and Backend - making it a valuable skill to comprehend.\nAlong with that fact thought, it seems the learning curve for RxSwift and Rx in general always seems \"hard\" to most people, or too hard to get started with. In this lecture I hope to debunk the myth and misconception of RxSwift being a hard concept, and put developers on the right path to start building Reactive Mobile applications for the modern world.",

In iOS 12, the power of Shortcuts allows you to much more fluidly interact with Siri, and have your application work with powerful system-level Shortcuts.\n\nYou?ll learn about the award-winning indie app that became Shortcuts, the easy and hard (and maybe even Galaxy Brain) ways of working with Shortcuts, and a few limitations of Shortcuts that will leave you itching for iOS 13.",

Accuracy can vary wildly, and users complain loudly if your app destroys their battery. Even worse, location services APIs often feel like black boxes, leaving even experienced developers scratching their heads how to debug them.\n\nSo how does it all actually work? How can your phone, solely using the position of a few satellites, figure out where you are to within a few meters? How, dare we ask, is the location technology sitting in our pockets indebted not only to the Cold War but to the navigational needs of 18th century sailors?\n\nWe'll explore the underlying technology behind GPS and location services, helping you better understand why things fail when they do, and how you can best design around the limitations of the technology.",

    "details" : "SwiftNIO was developed with a focus on providing useful, high-performance tools for building event-driven networking applications on the server side. It turns out that these primitives also work well in client applications. While the primitives transfer over, the networking environment is very different, and the socket layer, which works well in a server environment, is substantially less suited to operating on mobile clients. For this reason, SwiftNIO provides integration with the brand new Network.framework on Apple's client devices: a modern network stack for a mobile age. This talk will discuss the powerful tools that Network.framework provides, and how SwiftNIO exposes them. It'll discuss the different design tradeoffs between server and client side, and cover some of the key differences in the networking environments. Finally, this talk will look to the future, and discuss how the server and client worlds could converge over time.",
